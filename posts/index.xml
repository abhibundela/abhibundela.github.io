        <description>Hi friends,
Recently, I published an article where I explained a flaw in google groups functionality. When I submitted that vulnerability to Google I noticed that researchers can comment on the issue in issue tracker by replying to the email from buganizer system.
After submitting three N/A (wonâ€™t fix) report to Google, finally I managed to submit one valid report but unfortunately that was marked as duplicate. Thanks to Google security team, they are very responsive and allowed me to write about the vulnerability.</description>
