        <description>I found this vulnerability around 2 months ago in a consulting application. Their security team told me this application is already pentested and they will reward bonus if I could find a vulnerability. For new targets, first I analyze application and make a data flow diagram of its functionality then I start hunting for vulnerabilities. I extensively test for logical vulnerabilities because I know from my experience that there will be some critical transitions which might have been missed by application developers or testers.</description>
